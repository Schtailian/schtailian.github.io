Hi, my name is Kilian I'm a software developer from Italy/Southtyrol.

I was working as web developer (frontend and backend) from 2014 - 2020 and I am currently working as software developer in a wood panel factory. 

I am definitely not a bolgger but I am trying.

My languages of choice are C# and JS.
